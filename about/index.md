## About me

![](/img/circle-rin-profile-image.png)

I'm Rin, a lover of all things handmade. I was born in Japan where my grandmother is a tailor, so crafting is in my genes! I now live in Australia with my husband and two girls.

I love the simplicity and elegance of Japanese sewing patterns–my mission is to make them accessible to non-Japanese speakers. I’m also passionate about helping women discover their creativity and create a beautiful, meaningful life. 

For more about me, please come say hello at my crafting and slow living blog, [Sew in Love](https://www.sewinlove.com.au/?utm_source=JSP&utm_medium=about&utm_campaign=link).
