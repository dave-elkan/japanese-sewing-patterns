Oven mits make wonderful, practical handmade gifts. This Japanese sewing pattern is for an oven mit which also does
double duty as a hot pad.

I have translated this sewing pattern from the Japanese craft store, Otsuka-ya. Please download the Japanese sewing
pattern PDF before following the instructions below.

### Materials

Cotton fabric - 140cm x 30cm (22.8 x 9.5 inches)
Quilt batting - 30cm x 30cm
Bias tape* (0.8cm or ¼” wide) - 75cm or  inches
* I made my own bias tape using plain cotton fabric

### Before you start

Cut 4 circles with 22cm (8 ⅔”) diameter. Make a circular paper pattern for a neat finish. I cut 3 pieces out of floral
fabric, and 1 piece out of plain fabric. Also cut 1 circle out of the quilting wadding.

1. Make the hanging loop. Cut fabric 12cm x 4cm (). Fold and stitch as shown in diagram.
2. Wrong sides facing, fold 2 of the floral fabric circles in half. Press.
3. Stack fabric pieces in the following order:
   Floral print circle
   Quilting stuffing
   Plain fabric circle
   2 floral print folded semi-circles
   Loop you made in Step 1
   Bias tape

   Stitch 0.5cm () from the outer edge to attach the right side of the bias tape to the loop and the fabric pieces
   underneath.

4. Snip around the edges. Fold and press bias tape. Baste bias tape by hand to the other side of the oven mit.
5. Fold up and machine stitch loop.
