Oven mits make wonderful, practical handmade gifts. This Japanese sewing pattern is for an oven mit which also does
double duty as a hot pad.

I have translated this sewing pattern from the Japanese craft store, Otsuka-ya. Please [download the Japanese sewing
pattern PDF](http://otsukaya.co.jp/Tedukuri/1012.pdf) before following the instructions below.


### Materials

- Cotton fabric: 140cm x 30cm (22.8" x 9.5")
- Quilt batting: 30cm x 30cm (12" x 12")
- Bias tape* (0.8cm or ¼” wide): 75cm or  30"
* I made my own bias tape using plain cotton fabric

### Before you start

Cut 4 circles with 22cm (8 ⅔”) diameter. Use a circular paper pattern for a neat finish. I cut 3 pieces out of floral
fabric, and 1 piece out of plain fabric. Also cut 1 circle out of the quilt batting.

1. Make the hanging loop. Cut fabric 12cm x 4cm (5" x 1.6"). Fold and stitch as shown in diagram.

2. Wrong sides facing, fold 2 of the floral fabric circles in half. Press.
3. Stack fabric pieces in the following order:
   - Floral print circle
   - Quilting stuffing
   - Plain fabric circle
   - 2 floral print folded semi-circles
   - Loop you made in Step 1
   - Bias tape

   Stitch 0.5cm (0.2") from the outer edge to attach the right side of the bias tape to the loop and the fabric pieces
   underneath.
