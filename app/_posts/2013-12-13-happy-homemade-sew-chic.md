Yoshiko is the author behind the extremely popular Stylish Dress Book series. It’s nice to see her books slowly being
translated to English, using Western sizing.

Happy Homemade Sew Chic suits the absolute beginner to dressmaking. The designs are extremely simple, many consisting of
straight-cut styles. This means instead of a sewing pattern, rectangles are used to construct garments.

### Highlights

**Design L - Straight-cut Sarouel Pants**

These pants are featured on the cover of the book. I really like the ethnic vibe of this relaxed pattern. The cropped length is just perfect to wear with summer sandals
and flats. I plan on making a pair out of Indonesian batik print fabric.

**Design S - Sleeveless Blouse with Frill**

This blouse is a great way to show off a great, floral fabric. The ruffles are much easier to produce than they look.
You’ll become a master of gathering fabric once you’re done making this piece!

**Design T - Double-cuff Bermuda Shorts**

The cuffs and belt loops make these shorts suitable for casual outings. The elastic waistband is cleverly hidden by
wearing a smart belt. It’s nice to have comfort whilst still achieving a tailored-look.

### Conclusion

Whilst the designs are not as exciting or unique as her other books, Happy Homemade is a great introduction to Japanese
sewing patterns. Whether it’s your first Japanese sewing book, or your first foray into dressmaking, you’ll definitely
find success with this book.
