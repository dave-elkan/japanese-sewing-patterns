2. Press along the dotted lines of the Hakama Pants , bringing the circle symbol to the arrow head, creating two large box pleats on each piece.

3. Press and stitch the large box pleats in place, using this tutorial as a guide: http://dr-cos.com/kt-12boxpleatskirt4.html

4. Stitch back crotch and sides of Hakama Pants together.

5. Attach stiff interfacing to front and back Shin Guards. The bottom pattern piece in the photo below is the template for the interfacing. Attach Top and Bottom Ties you made in Part 2 to front Shin Guard at positions marked by +.　Stitch edges of front and back Shin Guards together to make a cylinder shape. Right sides facing, insert Shin Guard into leg opening of Hakama Pants. Stitch together.
