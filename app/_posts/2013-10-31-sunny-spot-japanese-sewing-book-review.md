*A Sunny Spot* is a must have book if you have daughters or granddaughters! In Japanese, the book title actually translates to *Everyday
Clothes for Girls*. The garments are casual and relaxed enough to wear as play clothes and to wear to school. Some
outfits can also be dressed up to wear on a stylish day out.

### Highlights

This beautifully photographed book gives you lots of styling ideas for the garments you can make.

**Pattern D, Daily Dress with Round Collar** is really adorable on its own, but I love how it looks paired with a pair of jeans. Makes it much more suitable for little girls who like to run around!

The sewing process for Pattern D is included in the book as a step-by-step tutorial. The photos help you to understand the more complicated steps.

**Pattern F, Camisole and Pants** looks like a romper when worn together. How clever!

**Pattern O, Border Knit Coat** is a little bit grown-up, but I think it would be a great piece to get through the cooler days in spring and fall. A sewing pattern for the detachable fur collar is also included in this book.

### Conclusion

No wonder this book is a best seller in Japan. It’s not only beautiful to look at, but the sewing patterns produce practical, but unique clothes for little girls. You can check out the author’s blog, [A Sunny Spot](http://blog.a-sunny-spot.com/) to see her latest projects.
