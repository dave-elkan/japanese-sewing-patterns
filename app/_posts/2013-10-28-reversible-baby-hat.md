This Japanese sewing pattern for a reversible baby hat is available for free download from the Japanese sewing blog, “Handmade no Kokoro”.

This cute baby hat is adjustable, because of the elasticated headband and ribbon trim. That means it’ll take some time before your baby grows out of wearing this special, handmade hat!
