Here's a video review taking a look inside a fantastic kids' clothing sewing book, Sew Chic Kids. It's full of timeless, basic pieces - perfect for play clothes!

The sizing in Japan for children uses height. Having a look at average kids' heights in the US, this book would be suitable from 3 year olds to 8 year olds.

Big thanks to Tuttle Books for sending me this wonderful book to review!

### Highlights

The video review shows you some of my favorite designs from this book. You'll notice that the majority of the designs in the book are for girls. I guess only girls get to wear dresses! There are however, some fantastic unisex tops and shorts to complement the handful of boys designs. You can always get creative with different fabrics (cotton, chambray, linen, etc) to make a great wardrobe for boys too!
