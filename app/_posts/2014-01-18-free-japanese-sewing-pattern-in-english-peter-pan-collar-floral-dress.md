Please visit Clover Japan and [DOWNLOAD THE FREE SEWING PATTERN](http://www.clover.co.jp/recipe/c282otonawanpi.pdf).

The following is an English translation of the original Japanese version. 

##Materials

- Floral Fabric^ - 110 cm x 250cm or 43 x 98.5 inches
- Plain Fabric - 110 cm x 40cm or 43 x 16 inches
- Fusible Interfacing - 50cm x 40cm or 20 x 16 inches 

^ *I used plain fabric for the collar only, whereas the pattern makes the collar, waist cord and the bias tape for sleeves, all in plain fabric. I also shortened the length of my dress by about 5 inches so it sits at my knees.*

*Fabric Suggestions: cotton, rayon*

##Size

Japanese ladies size M, which fits about a US 4 or UK 8. 

##Printing and Drafting the Pattern

The [free dress sewing pattern](http://www.clover.co.jp/recipe/c282otonawanpi.pdf) needs to be printed without scaling on A4 or Legal Size paper. 

Draft the sewing pattern for the main section of the dress by following the measurements on Page 2 of the printed pattern. ALL MEASUREMENTS ARE IN MILLIMETRES (MM).

Trace the sewing pattern for the collar, front yoke and back yoke from Page 3 of the printed pattern.

The sewing pattern DOES NOT include a seam allowance. Make sure you add the correct seam alowance before cutting out your fabric. Unless specified in the diagram below, all seam allowance is 1cm (0.4 in). For example, the BACK piece has a seam allowance of 1cm on all edges except for the hem, which requires a 4cm (1.6 in) seam allowance.

##Method

1. Press interfacing on collars. Right sides together, stitch each collar along the curved outer edge. Turn over to right side and stitch closely along the edge.

2. Zig-zag stitch along the sides of all 3 front pieces. Right sides facing, stitch pieces together, leaving a gap for the waist cord. Press seams open. Stitch a rectangule around the waist cord gaps.
