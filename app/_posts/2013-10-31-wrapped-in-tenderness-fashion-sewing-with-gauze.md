The author of this Japanese sewing book is the designer behind the Japanese fashion brand, inner-child. This brand
centres its designs on gauze fabric, making the most of its breathability and softness.

Like the fashion line, all garments in this book are made using gauze. The fabric is beautifully manipulated using
gathering and ruffling details. This sewing book is more fashion forward than your typical Japanese sewing book.

### Highlights

Design C - Big puff blouse and “dokata” pants

This blouse is so understated and chic. It reminds me of something from a Madewell catalogue. The conservative neckline
is off-set by the puff sleeves with a dramatic slit in the arm. It matches perfectly with the casual, ethnic style pants.

Design L - Shirring blouse and easy pants

It’s amazing what gathering and ruffles can do to gauze. This sleeveless blouse kept from being too girly with the use
of a cool, grey fabric. The pants have a drawstring waist and two front pockets. It’s a handy sewing pattern to have on
hand to make relaxed, weekend wear. I think these pants would work well made out of linen too.

Design M - Bow tie blouse of organic cotton gauze

This blouse is the casual version of the tuxedo shirt. The front bow and ruffles, gathered cuff and the elastic
waistline keeps the design uniquely feminine. The book’s cover also features this design.

### Conclusion

If you are looking for something other than the smock dresses and tunics you find in most Japanese sewing pattern books,
Inner Child’s Wrapped in Tenderness could be for you. You’ll be surprised to see the fashion that can be created out of
gauze!
