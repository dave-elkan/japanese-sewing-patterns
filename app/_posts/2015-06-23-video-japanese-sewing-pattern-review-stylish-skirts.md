Skirts, skirts and more skirts! If you consider yourself a skirt person (instead of jeans or pants), this sewing pattern book is for you. Consisting of 23 different skirt designs, the book claims to have something to flatter every figure. From gathered skirts, to A-line, pleated and tiered, you'll find all types of skirts in one, concise sewing pattern book.

One thing to note about this book is that it does not come with traceable sewing patterns. You must draft the sewing patterns yourself using your own waist and hip measurements.

Big thanks to Tuttle Books for sending me this wonderful book to review!

### Highlights

The video review shows you some of my favorite designs from this book. My top pick is the sailor skirt with buttons on the front. It would work really well in a denim or tweed, paired with a striped top to achieve that nautical look which seems to come back into fashion every summer!
