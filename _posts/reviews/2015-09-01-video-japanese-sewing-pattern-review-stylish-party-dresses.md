Party wear and formal occasions are a great reason to get sewing. There are many casual sewing pattern books out there, so it's great to see designs specifically for those times you need to get dressed up!

Although the title is *Stylish Party Dresses*, the book also includes several bolero jackets and two-piece sets. What I love about a top and skirt set is by wearing them together, you can look quite formal, but you can wear them separately with jeans or a casual top to get more outfits. Two-piece sets are wonderful if you are traveling for a wedding or some other special occasion.

### Highlights

The video review shows you some of my favorite designs from this book. My top pick is the taffeta two piece set because I think the pleated detail on the top is absolutely gorgeous.
