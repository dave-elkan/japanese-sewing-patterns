Stylish Dress Book is the book that really fuelled the popularity of Japanese sewing pattern books internationally. Even though the original Japanese version was published back in 2008, Stylish Dress Book remains extremely...well, stylish!

I've done a video tutorial, available on YouTube for this book. It makes it easier to share more pictures from the book. I hope you like it.

### Highlights

**Design M - Scallop-edged dress**

If you can find the right fabric, this v-neck dress is the perfect sewing pattern to show it off. The use of the scalloped edge for the sleeves is especailly creative.

**Design T - Liberty-print dress with chic black trim**

The black trim gives this smock style dress a chic, understated look. I'm making this dress using crepe de chine silk over on my [sewing blog, Sew in Love](https://www.sewinlove.com.au/2014/03/29/stylish-dress-book-wear-freedom-dress-sew-along-part-1/). It's a sew-along, so please join in!

### Conclusion

If you're going to buy one Japanese sewing pattern book, I highly recommend this one. 

Thank you to Tuttle Books for providing the book for this review.
