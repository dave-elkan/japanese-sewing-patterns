This Japanese sewing pattern books is the second in the "wrapped in tenderness" series. We had a look inside the [first book here](http://www.japanesesewingpatterns.com/reviews/2013/11/10/wrapped-in-tenderness-fashion-sewing-with-gauze.html).

Similar to the first book, this one also showcases double gauze, or Japanese gauze as the main fabric. The designs in this book are more girly, and include lots of frills as embellishment.

### Highlights

The video review shows you some of my favourite designs from this book. You can use lighter weight cotton as a replacement for double gauze; it can be hard to find double gauze outside of Japan. I particularly liked Design L, a skirt with a smocked waistband and tulle overlay. You can see my version of it, using a light polyester fabric, over on my blog, [Sew in Love](https://www.sewinlove.com.au/2013/06/03/japanese-yellow-tulle-smockedskirt-pattern/
).
