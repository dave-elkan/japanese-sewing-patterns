## Part 4: Sewing instructions for Hand Guards and Bodice

Important: All pattern pieces already include a seam allowance.

1. To make the Hand Guard (photo of pattern piece is below), place a loop of string large enough to fit your middle finger in the position marked at the centre of the rounded edge. Place loop between the front and back Hand Guards and stitch all the way around the edge. Leave a small gap to turn Hand Guard to the right side.

2. Attach six Hand Guard Ties you made in Part 2 to each Hand Guard on positions marked by +.

3. Zig-zag stitch along the edges of the Bodice and Sleeves. Photo below shows Collar (A), Bodice (B) and Sleeves (C).

4. Stitch edges and back centre of the Bodice together and press seams open.

5. Attach Collar in between positions marked by circles.

6. Make the Sleeves by stitching edges together. Hem the sleeves. Attach to Bodice.

Finished!
