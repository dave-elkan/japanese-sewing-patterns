This Japanese sewing pattern for a reversible baby hat is available for free download from the Japanese sewing blog,
“Handmade no Kokoro”.

This cute baby hat is adjustable, because of the elasticated headband and ribbon trim. That means it’ll take some time
before your baby grows out of wearing this special, handmade hat!

##Method 

*(Please visit [Handmade no Kokoro](http://handmadenokokoro.web.fc2.com/katagami/017.html) to see more step-by-step photos)*

1. [Download and print sewing pattern](http://handmadenokokoro.web.fc2.com/katagami/pdf/017_tulip_hat.pdf) on A4 size paper. Add 5mm (⅕”) seam allowance to all edges before cutting out paper
pattern. Cut 6 pieces each from fabrics A and B.

2. Right sides facing, stitch the longer edges of the same fabric together. Leave a 2cm (⅘”) gap on one of the edges of the hat, for inserting drawstring cord later.

3. Stitch 6 pieces together to create each of the inner (Fabric A) and outer (Fabric B) hats. Press seams open at the
top of the hat, where pieces overlap.

9. Stitch along the two dashed lines of the sewing pattern. This creates a casing around the crown of the hat to insert
the cord.

Optional step: I stuck on an applique motif on the yellow side to add some interest.
