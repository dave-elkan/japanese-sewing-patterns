Basic Black is a Japanese sewing pattern book all about making clothing from black fabric. The author has selected garments which are enhanced by the simplicity of the color black. Here's a video review taking a look inside this book. If you are after conservative, classic pieces for your wardrobe, this might just be the book for you.

### Highlights

The video review shows you some of my favorite designs from this book. My top picks are the classic button down shirts, because they would work in black as well as any color you like. You can never have too many cotton shirts!
